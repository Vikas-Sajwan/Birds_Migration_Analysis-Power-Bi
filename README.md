# Birds_Migration_Analyysis-Power-Bi#

This repository contains the **BIRD_MIGRATION_DATASET**, a comprehensive dataset for analyzing migratory patterns of birds across different regions and environmental conditions using **Power BI**.

---

## üìä Project Objective

The main goal is to uncover actionable insights on bird migration by leveraging DAX, visualizations, slicers, KPIs, maps, and interactive dashboards in **Power BI**. These insights support wildlife researchers, ecologists, and conservationists in understanding:

- average flight distance by species and region 
- how does weather condition impact average speed of flight 
- which month have the longest average migration duration 
- average tag battery level of birds
- highest recorded flight distance
- average recovery time of birds
